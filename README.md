# 📡 Horizon Scan AI | Professional Edition

Horizon Scan AI is a web-based Strategic Foresight platform (Single-Page Application) designed to assist analysts, strategic planners, and innovators in detecting signals of change before they become mainstream trends.

This application fuses interactive matrix visualization with Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini AI) to transform scattered data points into actionable strategic insights.

✨ Key Features

Dynamic Scanning Matrix:

Visualize issues based on customizable X/Y axes (e.g., Impact vs. Uncertainty).

Includes 6 Pro Templates (Risk, Foresight, Innovation, etc.).

Interactive Canvas: Drag & drop nodes directly to adjust their weight/position.

AI-Powered Analysis:

Integrated with Google Gemini Flash.

Provides instant analysis on clusters, systemic patterns, and strategic recommendations.

Auto-Report: One-click generation of a full HTML/PDF report containing the visual map and AI narrative.

Signal Classification:

Auto-color coding for signal status: Emerging, Watchlist, Escalating, Critical, Structural.

Portable Project File:

Save your work as a standalone .html file.

Data is embedded inside the file. Send it to a colleague, and they can resume work immediately without needing a database or server.

Tutorial Mode:

An interactive, guided tour for new users to learn the interface quickly.

🚀 Quick Start Guide

Open the App: Double-click horizon_scanner.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

Initial Setup: Select a Matrix Template that fits your analysis goal (see the Masterclass section below).

Input Data:

Click any empty space on the grid to add a new node (Signal).

Fill in the Title, Description, and Classification.

Connect Nodes: Use Ctrl + Click in the edit menu to link related nodes (showing causality).

AI Analysis:

Enter your Google Gemini API Key in the header.

Click the Lightning Bolt ⚡ icon or go to the "AI Analysis" tab to trigger the intelligence engine.

Save & Report:

Click the Disk 💾 icon to save your progress as a project file.

Click the Report button to export a professional document for stakeholders.

🎓 Horizon Scanning Masterclass: The Complete Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Strategic Foresight. This section covers everything from basic definitions to advanced frameworks used in this tool.

Module 1: The Core Philosophy

Horizon Scanning is not about predicting the future. It is about detecting early warning signs of potential changes to better prepare for multiple possible futures.

"The future is not a destination, but a direction."

Module 2: The Anatomy of a Signal

In this tool, every "Node" represents a signal. Understanding the type of signal is crucial:

Signal Type

Definition

Strategic Action

Weak Signal

A piece of information that is ambiguous, new, or weird. Low frequency, potentially high impact.

Scan & Monitor

Emerging Issue

A signal that is gaining traction and volume. The direction of change is becoming visible.

Analyze & Assess

Trend

A change that has a clear direction and momentum (e.g., Aging Population).

Adapt & Align

Wild Card

Low probability, extremely high impact events (e.g., Global Pandemic, Solar Flare).

Contingency Planning

Module 3: The STEEP Framework

When adding nodes, consider looking through these lenses (STEEP) to ensure holistic scanning:

Social (Values, demographics, lifestyle)

Technological (Innovation, R&D, digital adoption)

Economic (Markets, trade, currency, inflation)

Environmental (Climate, resources, biodiversity)

Political (Regulations, geopolitics, policies)

Module 4: The 6 Analytical Matrices (Included Templates)

This tool provides 6 templates. Here is how to use them effectively:

1. Impact vs. Probability (Risk Matrix)

Purpose: Traditional Risk Management.

Top-Right (High/High): Critical Risks. Mitigation is mandatory immediately.

Top-Left (High Imp/Low Prob): Black Swans. Requires insurance or emergency drills.

2. Impact vs. Uncertainty (Foresight Matrix)

Purpose: Scenario Planning (The most strategic view).

Top-Right (High/High): Scenario Candidates. These are the critical uncertainties that will define different futures.

Top-Left (High Imp/Low Unc): Planning Realities. These are "inevitable futures" (e.g., demographics). Plan for them now.

3. Urgency vs. Importance (Priority Matrix)

Purpose: Action Planning & Eisenhower Matrix.

Top-Right: Do First.

Bottom-Right: Schedule.

Top-Left: Delegate.

4. Influence vs. Interest (Stakeholder Mapping)

Purpose: Managing actors in an ecosystem.

Top-Right: Key Players. Manage closely.

Bottom-Right: Show Consideration. Keep informed.

5. Novelty vs. Maturity (Innovation Radar)

Purpose: Technology tracking.

Top-Left (High Novelty/Low Maturity): Bleeding Edge/R&D. High risk, high reward.

Bottom-Right: Commodity. Standard tech.

6. Time Horizon vs. Impact

Purpose: Roadmap alignment.

X-Axis: How soon will this hit? (Short/Medium/Long Term).

Y-Axis: How hard will it hit?

Module 5: Avoiding Cognitive Biases

When performing a scan, be aware of these mental traps:

Confirmation Bias: Only looking for signals that confirm what you already believe.

Solution: Actively hunt for contradicting evidence.

Availability Heuristic: Overestimating the importance of information that is readily available (e.g., breaking news).

Solution: Dig deeper into niche sources (academic papers, patent filings).

Groupthink: Agreeing with the consensus to avoid conflict.

Solution: Encourage "Wild Card" thinking in the matrix.
